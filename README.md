# Simple-Sentiment-Model
Try to predict with twitter's database who will win the 2018 presidencial elections from Brazil
Using a scrap made by myself I downloaded some tweets by people who was writing about all the possible candidates of Brazil's 2018 elections
Them I cleaned those texts and run some models.

Just a simple project for my postgraduate studeis.
